# bitmap-indexing-technique
Bitmap indexing is a technique used in databases to efficiently handle large volumes of data.
In these bitmaps, each bit corresponds to a record in the database, with the bit set to 1 if the 
corresponding record belongs to that category and 0 if it doesn’t.
Bitmap indexing acts as a map or index that guides you to the specific records you're interested in, 
making data exploration much more efficient and interactive. The bitmap indexing scheme is 
known to not suffer from the “curse of dimensionality” and is especially efficient when the queries 
do not involve all of the attributes. It's like having a roadmap that helps you navigate through a 
vast landscape of data with ease.
